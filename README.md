# Accelerometer App

This is an app to see your device accelerometer sensor(s) and to respond to changes in acceleration in 3d space, meaning any movement or vibration.

## Usage

Open the app up and it should just work. You can see how your phone is moving on the x, y, z axes.

The Button on the left is an on/off toggle.

You can push slow and the accelerometer will update slowly.

Push the fast button and the accelerometer will update quickly!

This app is just for fun! Try it out when running as fast as you can!
